# Shapes-and-rotating-them-along-the-center
Using the graphics.h library creating several shapes and rotating them clockwise and anticlockwise along the center.

This repository contains a C/C++ program that demonstrates the rotation of various shapes using the `graphics.h` library.

## Shapes and Rotation

1. **Triangle**: A triangle is rotated around its centroid.
2. **Rectangle**: A rectangle is rotated around its center.
3. **Pentagon**: A pentagon is rotated around its centroid.
4. **Hexagon**: A hexagon is rotated around its centroid.
5. **Rhombus**: A rhombus is rotated around its center.

## Usage

1. **Environment Setup**: Ensure you have a C/C++ compiler with support for the `graphics.h` library.
2. **Compilation**: Compile the provided code file.
3. **Execution**: Run the compiled executable to see the shapes rotating on a graphics window.
4. **Interaction**: You can pause/resume rotation and change rotation direction using keyboard inputs:
   - Press 'q' or 'Q' to quit the program.
   - Press 'c' or 'C' to change the rotation direction (clockwise or counterclockwise).
